Study Description	One of the greatest enigmas of modern biology is how the geometry of muscular and skeletal structures are created and how their development is controlled during growth and regeneration. Scaling and shaping of vertebrate muscles and skeletal elements has always been enigmatic and required an advanced technical level in order to analyse the cell distribution in 3D. In this work, synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography (µCT) and chemical contrasting has been exploited for a quantitative analysis of the 3D-cell distribution in tissues of a developing salamander (Pleurodeles waltl) limb ñ a key model organism for vertebrate regeneration studies. We mapped the limb muscles, their size and shape as well as the number and density of cells within the extracellular matrix of the developing cartilage. By using tomographic approach, we explored the polarity of the cells in 3D, in relation to the structure of developing joints. We found that the polarity of chondrocytes correlates with the planes in joint surfaces and also changes along the length of the cartilaginous elements. Our approach generates data for the precise computer simulations of muscle-skeletal regeneration using cell dynamics models, which is necessary for the understanding how anisotropic growth results in the precise shapes of skeletal structures.

Protocol Description		Te Pleurodeles waltl (Spanish ribbed newt) colony was established from fertilized eggs produced in a laboratory colony located in Madrid, Spain. Animals originating from a wild population in the Donana National Park (Spain) were obtained for research purposes by Agustin Gonzalez. Te animals, used to prove the concept study were 4th/5th generation, developmental stage 41ñ42, 44ñ45 and 55A (approximate length of the whole larva was 3.7 cm). Staging of the larva was performed according to Joven et al. Te frontal amputated limbs were briefy washed in PBS and fxed in freshly mixed 4% PFA for 12hours at +4 degrees. A contrasting of the developing limbs was performed as follows: the samples were dehydrated in increasing ethanol grade (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%) at room temperature, 2 hours for each step, using a slow rotation of the samples. Te samples were transferred into a solution of 0.7% PTA (phosphotungstic acid) in 90% methanol and incubated at +4 degrees for 5 days using slow rotation and the PTA-contrasting solution was changed afer every 24 hours for a fresh one. Te samples were washed with 90% methanol overnight at +4 degrees and then rehydrated in a decreasing ethanol grade (90%, 70%, 50%, 30%) at room temperature, 2hours for each step and slow rotation.	# text about how the library was selected if not genome wide, transfection, knock outs etc.	Te contrast of the stained samples was checked by a conventional X-ray µCT. Following that, the developing limbs were embedded in 1.0% of agarose gel and placed in polypropylene tubes to avoid movement artefacts during tomography scanning. A polypropylene tube was fxed on a plastic rod by a silicone gun. Te rod, containing the sample, was put in the centre of the rotation stage axis. A ?CT scanning was performed using the laboratory system GE Phoenix v|tome|x L 240 (GE Sensing & Inspection Technologies GmbH, Germany) with a 180kV/15W maximum power nanofocus X-ray tube and a high contrast, fat panel detector DXR250 with 2048◊2048 px2 and a pixel size of 200◊200?m2 . Exposure time was 900ms in each of the 2200 projections acquired over a total angle of 360∞. Te utilized acceleration voltage and the current of the X-ray tube were 60 kV and 200?A, respectively. Te beam was fltered by a 0.2 mm-thick aluminium flter to reduce beam-hardening artefacts. Te tomographic reconstruction was done using the sofware GE phoenix datos|x 2.0 (GE Sensing & Inspection Technologies GmbH, Germany) with an isotropic voxel size of 2.5?m.	Reconstructed slices were further analysed using the freeware ImageJ and the Pore3D sofware library. Firstly, the segmentation of cartilaginous elements was carried out using the plugin ABSnake with a gradient threshold of 30 and a setting of 50 iterations. Tis plugin was applied to the dataset fltered by a Median 3D flter with a radius of 10 in all three dimensions. Te fnal cartilaginous element (i.e. developing P. waltl forearm) was obtained in ImageJ by using the segmented slices as a transparent-zero mask on the original, non-fltered dataset. Further analyses were carried out by using Pore3D. To separate the background, the extracellular matrix and the bright cell nucleus, a 3D K-means clustering algorithm was applied to divide the data into three classes. Te binary image of the class represented by the cell nuclei was consequently processed by the erosion and the blob analysis modules of Pore3D, which allowed for the determination of the number of blobs, i.e. the number of cells. Cell polarization was determined using the sofware, VGStudio Max 3.1, with its module Fiber orientation analysis. Te diferent tissues such as the skin epithelium and muscles were segmented semi-automatically in combination with the sofware Avizo and VGStudio Max 2.2 according to Tesarova et al.
